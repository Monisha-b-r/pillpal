*   **Pharmacy Finder:** Locate nearby pharmacies using your location.

## Technologies Used

*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) & React
*   **AI/Backend:** Genkit & Gemini 2.5 Flash
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI
*   **State Management:** React Context & Hooks (with `localStorage`)
*   **Data Sources:** Firebase Firestore (for pharmacy locations)

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. You can get the Firebase values by running the "auto create the firebase api key" command in the IDE. You will need to obtain a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.

```
# Google AI - Get from https://aistudio.google.com/
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# Firebase - These are generated by the IDE
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
```

## Deploying to Netlify

This project is configured for deployment on Netlify.

**Important:** For the deployed application to function correctly, you must add your environment variables to your Netlify site configuration:

1.  Go to your site's dashboard on Netlify.
2.  Navigate to **Site configuration** > **Build & deploy** > **Environment**.
3.  Add the same key-value pairs from your `.env` file. This includes your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and all the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` keys.

Without these variables, the AI features and Firebase integration will not work on your deployed site.
